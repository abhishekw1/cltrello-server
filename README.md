## Project Details

This project is a demonstration of a Trello-like application. Users can add boards, and within each board, they can create multiple columns. Each column can contain various tasks. Users have the ability to update board titles, column titles, and move tasks from one column to another. This project showcases a full-stack MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) application utilizing RESTful APIs and WebSockets.
